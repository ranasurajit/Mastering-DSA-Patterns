# Mastering-DSA-Patterns  

ðŸš€ A collection of Data Structures & Algorithms problems solved using **proven patterns**.  
This repo is designed to strengthen problem-solving skills by focusing on **reusable approaches** instead of isolated solutions.  

---

## ðŸ“š Why Patterns?  
Most coding interview questions can be solved using a **limited set of patterns** like:  
- Sliding Window  
- Two Pointers  
- Fast & Slow Pointers  
- Merge Intervals  
- Cyclic Sort  
- Hashing & Prefix Sum  
- Monotonic Stack / Queue  
- Binary Search Patterns  
- Heap / Priority Queue  
- Graph Traversal (BFS / DFS)  
- Backtracking  
- Dynamic Programming  

By practicing problems grouped under these patterns, you build the ability to quickly recognize and apply the right approach.

## ðŸ›  Repo Structure  
Each folder corresponds to a **DSA pattern** and contains:  
- Problem statement (as comments)  
- Intuition & approach  
- Time and space complexity analysis  
- Java implementation
